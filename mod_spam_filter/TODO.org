** TODO Parse meta-info given on RTBL blocked domains
*** default policy, eg `block-strangers` (basically hardcoded for now)
** TODO [0/3] Pubsub XEP bug? Publish node and retract node can only have one item? Needs clarification. Schema says otherwise. 
    - [ ] Ask Mailinglist
    - [ ] Bug report on p1/xmpp -> doesn‘t handle multiple items correctly
    - [ ] Evtl bug in ejabberd mod_pubsub
** TODO Forward Reports (is this the right place?). See [[https://pad.nixnet.services/s/1ZrHSLq0G][Simplified XMPP Incident Exchange]]

* Ideas/Wishlist
** Allow list of RTBL hosts
*** Config option for multiple hosts and their node-names respectivly (and maybe default policy)
*** Query list of RTBL hosts
*** Merge strategy for multiple results, block policies (if more than one host), eg
   - one
   - more_than_one
   - all
** Scoring system (eg: is spam domain? has url(s)? suspicious jid? suspicious host (ibr active)? etc ...)
**
